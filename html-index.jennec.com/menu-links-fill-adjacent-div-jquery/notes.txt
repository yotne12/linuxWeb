November 6, 2018, version one
This page loads dynamic content from sidebar menu link to ajacent div.
This page uses jquery load function.
Each function represents one link.  This could be done by passing a variable instead of passing the unique id which demands a function for each id.
page needs versioning for production.
this is also a main wrap, heading clearing two columns.
Column one is the sidebar menu and column two is the target for the new page.
This is a good solution for heading text positioning.
